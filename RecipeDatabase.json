    "introduction": "This vegan roast is going to be a classic at the Christmas table because it’s not dry at all, not too fine or too coarse, and it packs a LOT of flavor. I came up with this recipe to be a very quick version of the classic meatloaf, and I was not disappointed. The red lentils provide a protein base, they have a beautiful color, and are cooked in 10 min. without soaking. You can also go for brown lentils but they take much longer. I kept the seasoning very classic, although the soy sauce is very important as it brings a fuller flavor than simply using salt. When pureeing, make sure that there are still a few small chunky pieces left at the end to get a good texture. Serve this vegan roast with cranberry glaze, roasted potatoes, red cabbage, and vegan gravy to have a vegan feast like no other! Tip: I took the vegan gravy from Marco's vegan cabbage rolls recipe, which you can also find on Kitchen Stories - it's simply delicious!",
